### Colour Scheme
<img src="assets/docs/readme_screenshots/colormap.png">
The colour palette was generated by <a href="http://colormind.io/image/">Colormind</a> when submitted a world map found on a google search. 

### Fonts
Itim from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Itim?preview.text=Geography&preview.text_type=custom) was chosen as the font as it was clear, playful and had a hand-written feel which I felt suited the theme of the game. 

### Structure

The structure of the website was designed to be easy to navigate. 

The game consist of the following screens:

- A home page / start screen with instructions icon in the top line, game title and user login
- Choose game difficulty level screen
